# Decision 2025-08-30, part 2

(interactive - up one level: [`magnetite_os/`](../))

## Title
Implement Shared Resources at the Source Level

## Status
Accepted

## Rationale
- A great deal of effort has been spent on curating the commit
history in the working branches, so that binary-level dependencies
effectively don't exist 
(see [**Retrospect 2025-08-30**](./RETROSPECT.md)).
- The bootloader and the kernel can be expected to be so complex and
intertwined, that it would be indefensible to *not* share resources
at the source level.

## Consequences
- All past changes dedicated to implementing shared resources at the
binary level have been rolled back (see above).
- Shared resources **must** be exposed at the source level, either as
a Rust module, or as a Rust crate.
- Platform-specific behavior **must** be guarded off, and **should**
only be exposed through platform-agnostic handles whenever possible.

## Miscellaneous
