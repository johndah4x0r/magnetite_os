## Title
Project repository curation 2025-11-29

## Status
Accepted

## Rationale
- The project has so far been inactive, primarily due to unresolved
complexities that are no longer justified.
- The complexities are clustered around the [bootloader](../boot),
which hasn't yielded satisfactory results.

## Consequences
- The commit history of the project will be curated; problematic
commits will either be eliminated or rectified.
- Any remaining work in the `experimental` branch will be discarded.

## Miscellaneous
N/A
