# Decision 2026-02-12
**TL;DR? See _Miscellaneous_.**

(interactive - up one level: [`magnetite_os/`](../))

## Title
Reorganize shared resources module into a Rust crate

## Status
Accepted

## Rationale
- The decision to convert the `common` module into a Rust crate
was conceived out of the desire to clarify the hierarchy within
`common` and the relationship between the it and its dependents.
- Additionally, the use of a crate allows for a more targeted
generation of documentation, which may become useful as the
crate grows larger.

## Consequences
- The module `common` **shall** reside in the `common/src` folder,
and **should** be exposed by the `common/src/lib.rs` file.
- The module `common` **must** at the minimum contain the
`shared` and `arch` submodules.
- The hierarchy as defined in decision 2025-09-01 is revised, so
that `common::arch` handles architecture-specific definitions,
whereas `common::plat` handles platform-specific definitions.
- Both `common::plat::*` and `common::arch::*` **must** expose
the submodule `structs`.

## Miscellaneous
In essence, the `common` module has been converted into a
proper Rust crate. The internal hierarchy is more or less
the same, with the addition of the `plat` submodule.
