# magnetite_os/boot
A custom legacy bootloader written in x86 assembly and Rust

## Testing
TODO

You should run `make` in the project root directory, so as
to not clutter `magnetite_os/boot/` and ensure that paths
in the `Makefile` are resolved properly:
```bash
make debug_boot
```

Consult `magnetite_os/README.md` for more information regarding
test builds and live inspection runs.
