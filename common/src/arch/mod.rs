/*
    Architecture-specific definitions

    As per decision 2025-08-30, part 2, platform-specific
    definitions must be separated from shared defintions,
    and must be guarded off whenever possible.

    Definitions must be guarded off, so that incompatible
    routines aren't included at compile time - though they
    must still be present at the source level.
